# Deep Learning Studies

Exploring deep learning networks, for study purposes.

They are presented through notebooks, so you can understand and visualize any outputs
without needing to run any code.


## Quick Start

### Playing notebooks online (no installation required)

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/paulaceccon/deep-learning-studies/blob/main/" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

### Inspecting notebooks (without executing any code)

* <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/paulaceccon/deep-learning-studies/blob/main/index.ipynb"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg" alt="Render nbviewer" /></a>

* [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/paulaceccon/deep-learning-studies/blob/main/index.ipynb) also works, but it's not ideal: it's slower, the math equations are not always displayed correctly, and large notebooks often fail to open.
